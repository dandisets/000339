description: "In this study, we investigate how transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS)
  modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical limb stimulation
  through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex.
  Recordings were taken using a 32 channel Neuronexus electrode. Rats were anesthetized
  using isoflurane anesthesia at 2%. Recordings were taken while delivering peripheral
  electrical stimulation once every 5 seconds to analyze the neural response in the
  rat S1HL region, before ultrasound for 30 minutes and then afterwards for an hour,
  in order to determine how the ultrasound therapy effects the induced waveform in
  LFP. We delivered ultrasound for 5 minutes in a pulsed pattern at 5 different stimulation
  repetition frequencies (10 Hz, 50 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 125 Hz) to induce frequency
  dependent plasticity in a manner similar to that found following tetanic electrical
  stimulation. We hoped to investigate whether delivering tFUS that alters connectivity/correlation
  between the targeted neurons may alter collective responses as can be analyzed through
  induced LFP waveforms. The fundamental frequency of ultrasound used was 0.5 MHz,
  the pulse repetition frequency (PRF)  was 3 kHz, and the total duty cycle was 36%.
  This dataset includes LFP recordings, with 32 channels each. \n\nIn each subject,
  recordings are provided of \"pre\" and \"post\" tFUS for two different frequencies
  (SRF), and most contain recordings during the delivery of ultrasound and during
  rest periods between sessions of different ultrasound parameters. For example, a
  single subject may include \"100Hz_pre\", \"100Hz_post\", \"50Hz_pre\", \"50Hz_post\",
  which are the pre and post tFUS recordings for the two used parameters, and then
  \"50Hz\" and \"100Hz\", which are the recordings taken during stimulation, and \"rest1\"
  and \"rest2\", which are the rest periods between sessions. These names are preceded
  by a label such as \"BH280\", which is the subject label. Ultrasound is continuous
  during the ultrasound recordings. During the \"pre\" and \"post\" recordings, electrical
  stimulation is delivered once every 5 seconds approximately. Event trigger is not
  included in the dataset as it was not recorded due to using a separate system to
  stimulate. We suggest using threshold detection on a channel of LFP recordings in
  order to approximate trigger times, as events can be recognized by the jump in voltage.
  One could also approximate it by detecting the first event, and then add periods
  of 5 seconds to generate the rest of the trial times. "
