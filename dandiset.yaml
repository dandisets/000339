description: 'In this study, we investigate how transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS)
  modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical stimulation at
  hindlimb through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory
  cortex. Recordings were performed using a 32-channel NeuroNexusÂ® multi-electrode
  array. Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane at 2%. Recordings were taken while
  delivering peripheral electrical stimulation once every 5 seconds to analyze the
  neural response in the rat S1HL region, before ultrasound for 30 minutes and then
  afterwards for an hour, in order to determine how the ultrasound modulated the electrical
  stimulation induced local field potential (LFP) waveforms. We delivered ultrasound
  for 5 minutes in a pulsed pattern at 5 levels of sonication repetition frequencies
  (SRF) (10 Hz, 50 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 125 Hz) to induce frequency dependent plasticity
  in a manner similar to that is found following tetanic electrical stimulation. We
  investigated whether delivering tFUS that alters connectivity/correlation between
  the targeted neurons may alter collective responses manifested in the modulated
  LFP waveforms. The applied fundamental frequency of ultrasound was 0.5 MHz, the
  pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was 3 kHz, and the total duty cycle was 36%. This
  dataset contains LFP recordings, with 32 channels for each datafile.

  In each subject, recordings are provided with "pre" and "post" tFUS for two different
  frequencies (SRF), and most contain recordings during the delivery of ultrasound
  and during rest periods between sessions of different ultrasound parameters. For
  example, a single subject may include "100Hz_pre", "100Hz_post", "50Hz_pre", "50Hz_post",
  which are the pre and post tFUS recordings for the two used parameters, and then
  "50Hz" and "100Hz", which are the recordings taken during stimulation, and "rest1"
  and "rest2", which are the rest periods between sessions. These names are preceded
  by a label such as "BH280", which is the animal subject label. Ultrasound is delivered
  in a continuous paradigm, with pulses delivered at the stimulation repetition frequency
  continuously throughout the 5 minutes of stimulation. During the "pre" and "post"
  recordings, the peripheral electrical stimulation is delivered once every 5 seconds
  approximately. Electrical stimulation event trigger is not included in the dataset
  as it was not recorded due to using a separate system to deliver the electrical
  stimulation. We were using threshold detection on a channel of LFP recordings in
  order to detect the electrical stimulation events, in which events can be recognized
  by the quick rising of voltage. One could also approximate it by detecting the first
  event, and then add periods of 5 seconds to generate the rest of the trigger times.

  More details about the experimental details can be found in our paper published
  by Journal of Neural Engineering (DOI: 10.1088/1741-2552/ac889f).'
