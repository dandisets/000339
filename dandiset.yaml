description: In this study, we investigate how transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS)
  modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical limb stimulation
  through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex.
  Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane anesthesia at 2%. Recordings were taken
  while delivering peripheral electrical stimulation once every 5 seconds to analyze
  the neural response in the rat S1HL region, before and after ultrasound. We delivered
  ultrasound for 5 minutes in a pulsed pattern at 5 different stimulation repetition
  frequencies (10 Hz, 50 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 125 Hz) to induce frequency dependent
  plasticity in a manner similar to that found following tetanic electrical stimulation.
  The fundamental frequency of ultrasound used was 0.5 MHz, the pulse repetition frequency
  (PRF)  was 3 kHz, and the total duty cycle was 36%. This dataset includes LFP recordings.
